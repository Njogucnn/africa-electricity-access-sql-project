# Electricity Access in Africa (2000–2023)  
*A Data Analysis and Visualization Project Using SQL & Power BI*

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes trends in electricity access across African countries from 2000 to 2023. Using data from the World Bank, it highlights disparities between rural and urban areas, identifies top and bottom performers, and explores correlations with GDP per capita. The insights aim to support data-driven decisions in energy access, policy-making, and sustainable development.
